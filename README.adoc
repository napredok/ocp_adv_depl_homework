= OpenShift Container Platform - Advanced Deployment - Homework Template

Use the files in this repo to guide you on your way to creating a fully automated deployment of OpenShift.

The person grading the assignment will 

* launch a new homework environment
* clone a repo
* execute a command
* examine the output through log files
* examine the deployed OpenShift to ensure that all aspects of the homework were deployed properly.


Good luck!
